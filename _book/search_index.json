GC Digital Research Institute (GCDRI) is a week-long course in digital research methods held at The Graduate Center, CUNY. Organized by Graduate Center Digital Initiatives (GCDI), this intensive course is designed to provide an accessible introduction to technologies frequently used in serious digital research, including the command line, databases, the Python programming language, and the git version control system. Building on these core skills, later sessions in the GCDRI focus on more specialized approaches, such as natural language processing, machine learning, mapping, and data collection with APIs.This document provides a high-level overview of the GCDRI pedagogical model and presents the curriculum from the core and supplementary technical sessions. It also collates informational sessions on critical skills such as grant writing, sustainability, time management, and outreach.BackgroundThe GCDRI grew out of the work of the Digital Fellows, an interdisciplinary team of graduate students dedicated to developing and supporting digital approaches to research and pedagogy at the Graduate Center. The Fellows hold office hours, work with students and faculty, and lead a popular series of technical workshops each semester. Through this work, the Fellows became conscious of a need for a more sustained approach to teaching digital methods. While workshops, and workshop series, were well-received, there was little room during a busy semester to build the fundamental competencies that serve as a foundation for sustained inquiry and scholarship using digital methods.In recent years, alternative models for collaboration and pedagogy such as bootcamps, sprints, and hackathons have become the norm in the technology industry. These approaches emphasize close collaboration and sustained, intensive effort over a short period of time to reach a desired goal. For sprints and hackathons, this can be the creation of a project or feature over the course of a few hours or days. For bootcamps, the goal is usually to train participants in specialized technical skills in the space of a few weeks or months. Though some bootcamps and hackathons have been criticized for their overt commercialization and exploitative practices, these models have also been embraced by nonprofits and the open source community.The intensive pedagogical model has also been taking root within the academy. The nonprofit Software Carpentry Foundation, for example, teaches technical skills useful in the sciences. In addition, organizations such as Humanities Intensive Teaching and Learning (HILT) and the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) offer intensive courses for practitioners in the digital humanities, often with a conference component.Inspired by these models of intensive training both in and out of the academy, and with the generous assistance of a CUNY Strategic Investment Initiative grant, GCDI introduced the Digital Research Institute in summer 2015. Heavy demand for placement led to an expansion of the Institute from 30 participants in 2015 to 60 in summer 2016. The Institute, reflecting the interdisciplinary concerns of GCDI and the Digital Fellows, was designed to engage scholars in the sciences, social sciences, and  humanities. This is achieved by combining a foundational core in four flexible and widely used technologies with supplemental sessions in areas of more specialized interest. The Institute also emphasizes skills that contribute to the growth of a community of sustainable digital practice at the GC, offering workshops on outreach, grant writing, and project life cycle management. \n\n"},"philosophy.html":{"url":"philosophy.html","title":"Philosophy","keywords":"","body":"PhilosphySessions at the Digital Research Institute are divided into three categories: core, which provide a general foundation on which to build more specialized skills; supplemental, electives which are more likely to be more useful to researchers in specific areas or disciplines,; and professional development, which focus on non-technical skills necessary for undertaking successful projects."},"acknowledgements.html":{"url":"acknowledgements.html","title":"Acknowledgements","keywords":"","body":"Acknowledgements"},"core.html":{"url":"core.html","title":"Core Sessions","keywords":"","body":"Core SessionsThe DRI's core sessions teach four flexible skills that provide a foundation for more specialized learning later in the week.

The command line, for example, can be used by itself to automate common workflows or interactively explore data sets, but is primarily used to interact with other tools or set up a programming environment.

You may hear it called different names, such as the terminal, the shell, or bash. In practice, you can use these terms interchangeably. (If you're curious, though, you can read more about them in the glossary.)Why is the command line useful?Initially, the command line can seem like a weird and old-fashioned way of interacting with the computer. However, by using the command line, you're stepping away from an environment where things are done for you and moving into an environment where you have more control. Instead of ordering your food in a restaurant, you're stepping into the kitchen. It's more work, but there are also more possibilities.The command line allows you to...Easily automate tasks such as creating, copying, and converting files.\n\nSet up your programming environment.\n\nRun programs you create.\n\nAccess the (many) programs and utilities that do not have graphical equivalents.\n\nControl other computers remotely.\n\nIn addition to being a useful tool in itself, the command line gives you access to a second set of programs and utilities and is a compliment to learning programming.In the next section, we'll get started using the command line."},"intro-command-line/sections/getting-to-the-command-line.html":{"url":"intro-command-line/sections/getting-to-the-command-line.html","title":"Getting to the command line","keywords":"","body":"Getting to the command lineOSXIf you're using OSX:Click the Finder button (the magnifying glass) in the top right of your desktop.\nType \"Terminal\" into the bar that appears.\nSelect the first item that appears in the list.\nThe terminal will look like this:\nWhen you see the $, you're in the right place.WindowsWe won't be using Windows's own, non-UNIX version of the command line.

Let's try our first command. Type the following and press enter:$ whoami\nThe whoami command should print out your username. Congrats, you've executed your first command! This is a basic pattern of use in the command line: type a command and receive output.Orienting yourself in the command line: foldersOK, we're going to try another command. But first, let's make sure we understand some things about how your computer's filesystem works.Your computer's files are organized in what's known as a hierarchical filesystem. That means there's a top level or \"root\" folder on your system. That folder has other folders in it, and those folders have folders in them, and so on. You can draw these relationships in a tree:Users\n|\n-- patrick\n  |\n  -- Photos\n  -- Documents\nThe root or highest-level folder on OSX is just called /. We won't need to go in there, though, since that's mostly just files for the operating system. On Windows, the root directory is usually called C:.OK, let's try a command that tells us where we are in the filesystem:$ pwd\nYou should get output like /Users/patrick. That means you're in the patrick directory in the Users folder inside the / or root directory. On Windows, your output would instead be C:/Users/patrick. The folder you're in is called the working directory, and pwd stands for \"print working directory.\"OK, we know where we are. But what if we want to know what files and folders are in the patrick directory, a.k.a. the working directory? Try entering:ls\nYou should see a number of folders, probably including Documents, Desktop, and so on. You may also see some files. These are the contents of the current working directory.I wonder what's in the Desktop folder? Let's try moving to it with the following command:$ cd Desktop\n(Make sure the \"D\" in \"Desktop\" is capitalized. ) If the command was successful, you won't see any output. This is normal—often, the command line will succeed silently.So how do we know it worked? That's right, let's use our pwd command again. We should get:$ pwd\n/Users/patrick/Desktop\nNow try ls again to see what's on your desktop. These three commands—pwd, ls, and cd—are the most commonly used in the terminal. Between them, you can orient yourself and move around. Before we move on, let's take a minute to move around in the command line.ChallengeUse the three commands you've just learned—pwd, ls and cd—eight (8) times each. Go poking around your Photos folder, or see what's so special about that scary root / directory. When you're done, come back to the home folder withcd ~\n(That's a tilde, on the top left of your keyboard.) One more command you might find useful iscd ..\nwhich will move you one directory up in the filesystem. That's a cd with two periods after it.Example:"},"intro-command-line/sections/creating-files-and-folders.html":{"url":"intro-command-line/sections/creating-files-and-folders.html","title":"Creating files and folders","keywords":"","body":"Creating files and foldersCreating a folderSo far, we've only performed commands that give us information. Let's use a command that actually affects the computer.First, make sure you're in the home directory:$ pwd\n/Users/patrick\nLet's move to the Desktop folder with cd:cd Desktop\nOnce you've made sure you're in the Desktop folder with pwd, let's try a new command:touch foo.txt\nIf the command succeeds, you won't see any output. Now move the terminal window and look at your \"real\" desktop, the graphical one. See any differences? If the command was successful and you were in the right place, you should see an empty text file called \"foo.txt\" on the desktop. Pretty cool, right?Creating foldersOK, so we're going to be doing a lot of work during the Digital Research Institute. Let's create a project folder in our home directory so that we can keep all our work in one place.First, let's check to make sure we're still in the Desktop folder with pwd:$ pwd\n/Users/patrick/Desktop\nOnce you've double-checked you're in Desktop, we'll use this command to make a folder called \"projects\":mkdir projects\nNow do ls to see if a projects folder has appeared. Once you confirm that the projects folder was created successfully, cd into it.$ cd projects\n$ pwd\n/Users/patrick/Desktop/projects\nOK, now you've got a projects folder that you can use throughout the Institute. It should be visible on your graphical desktop, just like the foo.txt file we created earlier.Example"},"intro-command-line/sections/creating_a_cheat_sheet.html":{"url":"intro-command-line/sections/creating_a_cheat_sheet.html","title":"Creating a cheat sheet","keywords":"","body":"Creating a cheat sheetIn this section, we'll create a text file that we can use as a cheat sheet. You can use it to keep track of all the awesome commands you're learning.Instead of creating an empty file like we did with touch, let's try creating a file with some text in it. But first, let's learn a new command: echo$ echo \"Hello from the command line\"\nHello from the command line\nBy default, the echo command just prints out the text we give it. Let's use it to create a file with some text in it:echo \"This is my cheat sheet\" > cheat-sheet.txt\nNow let's check the contents of the directory:$ pwd\n/Users/patrick/projects\n$ ls\ncheat-sheet.txt\nOK, so the file has been created. But what was the > in the command we used? On the command line, a > is known as a \"redirect.\" It takes the output of a command and puts it in a file. Be careful, since it's possible to overwrite files with the > command.Let's check if there's any text in cheat-sheet.txt.cat cheat-sheet.txt\nThis is my cheat sheet\nAs you can see, the cat command prints the contents of a file to the screen.Using a text editorThe challenge for this section will be using a text editor to add some of the commands that we've learned to the newly created cheat sheet. Text editors are programs that allow you to edit plain text files, such as .txt, .py (Python scripts), and .csv (spreadsheet files). Remember not to use programs such as Microsoft Word to edit text files, since they add invisible characters that can cause problems. During the Institute, we'll be using Sublime as our text editor.ChallengeOpen Sublime Text and select File > Open file from the menu bar. Add the commands we've learned so far to the file. Include descriptions about what each command does. When you're done, save the file by selecting File > Save from the menu bar.Once you're done, check the contents of the file on the command line with the cat command:$ cat cheat-sheet.txt\nMy Institute Cheat Sheet\n\nls\nlists files and folders in a directory\n\ncd ~\nchange directory to home folder\n\n...\nExample"},"intro-command-line/sections/pipes.html":{"url":"intro-command-line/sections/pipes.html","title":"Pipes","keywords":"","body":"PipesSo far, you've learned a number of commands and one special symbol, the > or redirect.

The result is the reverse of the text that we entered.Let's try a more practical example. What if we wanted to put the commands in our cheat sheet in alphabetical order?Use pwd and cd to make sure you're in the folder with your cheat sheet. Then try:cat cheat-sheet.txt | sort\nYou should see the contents of the cheat sheet file with each line rearranged in alphabetical order.

(Hope you're keeping it up to date!) Let's try working with a large text file, one that would be too large to work with by hand.Let's download the data we're going to work with:Download nypl_items.csvOnce it's downloaded, move it from your Downloads folder to the projects folder on your desktop.Our data set is a list of public domain items from the New York Public Library. It's in .csv format, which is a plain text spreadsheet format. CSV stands for \"comma separated values,\" and each field in the spreadsheet is separated with a comma. It's all still plain text, though, so we can manipulate the data using the command line.Viewing data in the command lineTry using cat to look at the data. You'll find it all goes by too fast to get any sense of it. (You can do Control-C to cancel the output if it's taking too long.)Instead, let's use another tool to get the data one page at a time:$ less nypl_items.csv\n[...]\nThis gives you a paginated view of the data. You can use Control-v and Alt-vto move down or up one page. (On Macs, use  and .) Once you're done, hit q to return to the command line.Let's try two more commands for viewing the contents of a file:$ head nypl_items.csv\n[...]\n$ tail nypl_items.csv\n[...]\nThese commands print out the first and last sections of the file respectively.Cleaning the dataWe didn't tell you this before, but there are duplicate lines in our data! Two, to be exact. Before we try removing them, let's see how many entries are in our .csv file:$ cat nypl_items.csv | wc -l\n100001\nThis tells us there are 100,001 lines in our file. The wc tool stands for \"word count,\" but it can also count characters and lines in a file. We tell wc to count lines by using the -l flag.

If you complete all of them, you'll have a good sense of the various ways to create your own commands in the terminal, from creating aliases to writing your own bash scripts.Challenge #1: Create hidden fileUse the touch command to create a hidden file. Hidden files have a . in front of them, like this:$ ls -A\n.gitignore hello.txt\n$ ls\nhello.txt\nYou can also create hidden folders this way, but you only need to create a file to pass the challenge.Challenge #2: Create an aliasAll these commands are great and all, but what if I want to make my own command? For example, maybe I want to make this happen:$ peptalk\nPatrick is awesome!\nTo do this, use the alias command:$ alias peptalk=\"echo 'Patrick is awesome!'\"\nTo pass this challenge, make your own alias that does something different.Challenge #3: Make a permanent aliasSo you made an alias, but you realized it goes away when you close and reopen the terminal. (So unfair.) Make your alias permanent.To do this, you will need to edit the configuration file that your terminal runs when it starts up. On Git Bash, that's going to be called ~/.bashrc. (That's a .bashrc file in your home folder.) ON OSX, the file is called ~/.bash_profile. Just add the command you used to create the alias to the file with your text editor. Close and reopen the terminal to make sure your alias still works.Challenge #4: Create your own shell scriptYou're having fun with aliases, but are they REAL programs, or just glorified shortcuts?This challenge is to create a bash script, a REAL program written in bash. To do this, create a text file (I'll call this one goto-projects.sh) that begins with this line:#!/bin/bash\nUnder that, write some lines of bash that you want to be executed. How about a program that goes to your projects folder from wherever you are?cd ~/Desktop/projects\necho \"Now you're in $(pwd)\"\nYour script should look like this when you're done.goto-projects.sh:#!/bin/bash\n\ncd ~/Desktop/projects\necho \"Now you're in $(pwd)\"\nNow run this command to make your script executable. This gives your computer permission to run it as a program:$ chmod a+x goto-projects.sh\nNow run your program like this:$ ./goto-projects.sh\nChallenge #5: Make your script run from anywhereLast challenge! So you've made a real program in bash, you're probably feeling pretty proud of yourself. Deservedly so. But you still need to be in a folder with your program, and you still need to use that annoying ./ to run it. Let's make our program accessible from anywhere on the system by moving it to the /bin folder.sudo mv goto-projects.sh /bin/goto-projects\nThis moves your script from its current folder to the /bin folder and renames it from goto-projects.sh to goto-projects. Now close your terminal with exit and reopen it. Type$ goto-projects\nfrom anywhere and see if that runs your script. If it does, congratulations!

For the rest of this session, we're going to write and execute longer programs.Three ways of running scriptsFundamentally, Python programs are just text files. You can write them in a text editor like Sublime and pass them to Python, which will execute them one line at a time. Here are three ways to run your Python programs. All work equally well, so choosing one is a matter of preference. Pick one method and stick to it for now.Command line methodOpen your text editor of choice (such as Sublime) and create a new file with this line:print(\"Hello world!\")\nSave it with the name hello.py to a known location, such as your desktop. Open your terminal and move to the desktop directory:$ cd Desktop\nOnce you're in the folder with your hello.py file, run it with:$ python hello.py\nHello world!\nAs above, you should see the text Hello world! appear as output.IPython NotebookIPython Notebooks are graphical interfaces to Python that run in the browser. To start a notebook, enter$ ipython notebook\nin your terminal. You should see messages appear in your terminal window, and your browser should open to a list of files. Once IPython is open in the browser, click New in the top right and select Python under Notebook from the dropdown menu.THe IPython interface consists of cells, which can contain text or Python code. In the first cell (the blank space next to the text that says In [ ], enter the textprint(\"Hello world!\")\nthen hit Shift-Enter. You should see the output Hello world! appear below.IDEAn IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a program that can be used for both writing and running programs, and they usually come with a number of specialized features. Python comes with its own IDE, but it only runs well on Windows and Linux, not on OSX. More powerful cross-platform IDEs for Python exist, such as PyCharm and Spyder will also allow you to write and run Python programs on your desktop.

The last two allow you to create multi-line strings. Notice that you should not mix and match these opening and closing quotes, as you'll get an error:>>> print(\"Hello world!')\n  File \"\", line 1\n    print(\"Hello world!')\n                        ^\nSyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal\nYou've probably already seen similar messages as you've tried the examples so far, but if not...congratulations on your first error!

We'll talk more about errors in the next section.Differences between the REPL and running scriptsRemember how, in the REPL, we could do things like this?>>> x = 5\n>>> x\n5\nIn the REPL, the results after Python evaluates your input are automatically printed out for you. This is not the case with longer Python programs. If you want to see the output in the console, you'll need to use the print() function. (Notice that IPython cells are actually a beefed up version of the REPL that can take multiple lines, so if you're using the IPython method for running scripts, you can still do stuff like this.)"},"intro-python/loops.html":{"url":"intro-python/loops.html","title":"Loops","keywords":"","body":"LoopsRemember lists? They look like this:flowers = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']\nFor now, let's just create a list and print it out.

You should see the list as output.What if we want to print out each item in the list separately? For that, we'll need something called a loop:flowers = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']\n# print(flowers)\nfor flower in flowers:\n    print(flower)\nWhat's happening here? This kind of loop is called a \"for\" loop, and tells Python: \"for each item in the list, do something.\" Let's break it down:for  in :\n    \nIndented code like this is known as a \"code block.\" Python will run the  code in the code block once for each item in the list. The code in the code block doesn't have to refer to the variable at all:for flower in flowers:\n    print(\"Yay! I'm in a loop!\")\nYou can also perform more complicated operations:prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n\nfor num in prime_numbers:\n    print('The square of %s is:' % num)\n    print(num * num)\n"},"intro-python/conditionals.html":{"url":"intro-python/conditionals.html","title":"Conditionals","keywords":"","body":"ConditionalsConditionals allow programs to change their behavior based on whether some statement is true or false. Let's try this out by writing a script that will give different outputs based on the weather:weather = \"sunny\"\n\nif weather == \"sunny\":\n    print(\"Bring your shades\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\")\nIn our first line, we set a variable weather  to the string \"sunny,\" representing what the weather is like outside. The if statement checks whether the variable weather is set to \"sunny.\" If it is, the code in the block beneath is executed, so the text \"Bring your shades\" will be printed.The else statement handles any inputs that aren't \"sunny\"—the program merely prints out that it doesn't know what you should bring. Try this script out both with the variable set to \"sunny\" and the variable set to some other value.What if we want our program to handle other kinds of weather, giving different messages for each one? Other cases after the first if statement are handled with elif:weather = \"sunny\"\n\nif weather == \"sunny\":\n    print(\"Bring your shades\")\nelif weather == \"rainy\":\n    print(\"Bring your umbrella\")\nelif weather == \"snowy\":\n    print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\")\nYou can add as many elif statements as you need, meaning that conditionals in Python have one if statement, any number of elif statements, and one else statement that catches any input not covered by if or elif. Try adding more elif statements to this program to make it better able to handle different kinds of weather.Over the next sections, we'll work on improving this little application, making it able to handle user input directly."},"intro-python/input.html":{"url":"intro-python/input.html","title":"Input","keywords":"","body":"InputPython allows you to take input directly from the user using the input function.

(The space before the second \" makes the prompt look more tidy in the console.) It will then return some advice based on the input.Asking repeatedlyWhat if we want Python to keep asking for input instead of exiting after the first question is answered? For that, we can use somethign called a while loop.Remember our for loop? Instead of iterating through a list like the for loop, our while loop will continue to execute as long as a certain condition is true. Here's a very simple while loop that will run forever until you quit it manually. (Note: if you're using IPython, this may crash your notebook. It's safe to use in your terminal.)while True:\n    print(\"Oh no! I'm stuck...\")\nIf you're in the terminal, you can escape from this endless loop by pressing Control-c on your keyboard. In IPython, you can stop it by pressing the square STOP button in the toolbar.Let's apply the while loop to our weather app:while True:\n    weather = input(\"What is the weather like today? \")\n\n    if weather == \"sunny\":\n        print(\"Bring your shades\")\n    elif weather == \"rainy\":\n        print(\"Bring your umbrella\")\n    elif weather == \"snowy\":\n        print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\n    else:\n        print(\"I don't know what you should bring!

Now our program will ask us for input again and again, and give us different answers each time.Let's add one more feature: an elif statement that will break us out of the loop and end the program:while True:\n    weather = input(\"What is the weather like today? \")\n\n    if weather == \"sunny\":\n        print(\"Bring your shades\")\n    elif weather == \"quit\":\n        break\n    elif weather == \"rainy\":\n        print(\"Bring your umbrella\")\n    elif weather == \"snowy\":\n        print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\n    else:\n        print(\"I don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\")\nThe break command ends the current loop early, ending the program when \"quit\" is given as input."},"intro-python/google.html":{"url":"intro-python/google.html","title":"Using Google","keywords":"","body":"Finding Answers with GoogleOur weather app is working pretty well, but you may have noticed that it's case sensitive:What is the weather like today? snowy\nBring your wooly muffler\nWhat is the weather like today? SNOWY\nI don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\nHow could we fix our program to handle cases like this? We could add a bunch of new elif statements, like this:[...]\nelif weather == \"snowy\":\n    print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\nelif weather == \"SNOWY\":\n    print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\n[...]    \nThis is a lot of work, and it's a pretty ugly solution. If we wanted to add more cases to our program, we would have to write them in twice every time, and it still wouldn't fix inputs like Snowy. The best way to improve our program would be to convert the input to lower case before we send it to our if/else block.Googling for answersEven if you're a super rad Python programmer, you're not going to remember every function name or how to do things you might not have touched in awhile. One thing programmers get very good at is googling for answers. In fact, this is arguably the most important skill in modern-day programming. So let's use Google to find out how to convert strings to lower case.Let's try the search term make string lower case Python:Notice that the first result is from a site called Stack Overflow. This is a questions and answers site for programmers that usually has strong answers to questions about Python.On the Stack Overflow page, take a quick look at the question to make sure it's relevant to your problem. However, we need to scroll down to the answers to find what we're looking for:Implementing our answerAccording to this answer, we can make a string lowercase by adding .lower() to the end of it, like this:>>> \"SNOWY\".lower()\n'snowy'\nOK, that seems to work, even if we don't really know what's going on with that dot. Let's incorporate this transformation into our weather app:while True:\n    weather = input(\"What is the weather like today? \")\n    weather = weather.lower()\n\n    if weather == \"sunny\":\n        print(\"Bring your shades\")\n    elif weather == \"quit\":\n        break\n    elif weather == \"rainy\":\n        print(\"Bring your umbrella\")\n    elif weather == \"snowy\":\n        print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\n    else:\n        print(\"I don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\")\nThis new script should handle any combination of upper or lowercase characters. The new second line sets the weather variable to a new value, weather.lower(), which is a lowercase version of the original input.There's no shame in googling for answers! Error messages are especially useful to google when you run into them. Keep an eye out for Stack Ocerflow answers, as they tend to have useful examples. The official Python documentation will also frequently come up, but I would recommend avoiding it as a resource until you have more programming experience. It's a great resource, but the way information is presented can be confusing at first."},"intro-python/importing.html":{"url":"intro-python/importing.html","title":"Importing modules","keywords":"","body":"Importing librariesOne of the main advantages of Python is that you can draw on code written by other programmers to solve a wide variety of problems. This importable code goes by a number of names, such as libraries, packages, and modules, but knowing the technical distinctions among these terms isn't that important. Python comes with a large standard library, which means that many modules are available to you without your having to install them first. In addition, Anaconda comes with another set of modules, such as NumPy, SciPy, NLTK, and Flask, that do not come with the standard Python library.Use an import statement to make code from a module available in your script:import random\nThe above code imports the random module, which allows you to create pseudorandom numbers. Let's try it out:import random\n\nprint(random.randint(1, 10))\nEvery time you run this program, you will get a different random number from 1 to 10. Notice that, in order to access the randint function that creates the random numbers, you need to prefix it with a dot . and the name of the library, like this: random.randint(1, 10) This is by design, since a frequent problem in programming is having variables and functions with the same name.When you import a module, Python creates a \"namespace\" for that module. You can access objects within that namespace with the . syntax, like we did with random.randint.In the next (and last) section, we'll use the random module to create a fortune cookie script that will pront some motivational (or demotivational) aphorisms."},"intro-python/motivate.html":{"url":"intro-python/motivate.html","title":"A little motivation","keywords":"","body":"A Little MotivationEarly on, we learned a bit about lists, which look like this:['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']\nWe're going to create a small application that will print a random motivational saying every time a user presses Enter. Our first step will be to create a list of positive sayings:motivational_phrases = [\n    \"You look awesome today!\",\n    \"You're a Python prodigy!\",\n    \"You write lists like a pro!\"\n    ]\nLists open with a square bracket [, have items seperated with commas, and end with a square bracket ], like this:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nOur positivity list above spreads the list out over multiple lines for greater readability, which is allowed in Python. Remember that you can change the strings in the list to whatever phrases you choose.Now that we have our sayings, let's use it in conjunction with some functionality from our random module:import random\n\nmotivational_phrases = [\n    \"You look awesome today!\",\n    \"You're a Python prodigy!\",\n    \"You write lists like a pro!\"\n    ]\n\nprint(random.choice(motivational_phrases))\nThe random.choice function chooses a random item from a list and returns it. Note that it's good Python style to put all import statements at the top of a file.As with our weather app, this positive saying generator could be improved by making it so the program doesn't have to run again every time to get new output. Let's add a while loop for the final version:while True:\n    import random\n\n    motivational_phrases = [\n        \"You look awesome today!\",\n        \"You're a Python prodigy!\",\n        \"You write lists like a pro!\"\n        ]\n\n    print(random.choice(motivational_phrases))\n    input()\nThe empty input() statement at the end means that the user has to hit Enter again in order to see a new phrase.This brings us to the end of our Python session.
